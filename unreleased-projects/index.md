	I don’t remember much about Poké Pals Runner except that it was made in Game Maker 8.1 as a personal project at school. From what I remember at the time I was playing Poké Park 2: Wonders Beyond and decided to make an endless runner based on Pikachu, Oshawott, Snivy and Tepig. However, I didn’t know how to make an endless runner so I made a simple avoid the walls game featuring pretty terrible Google Image searched sprites of the characters and an overall terrible MS Paint background style. The game was never completed but was close to finished until I abandoned it and never thought to archive the build I had created.

	Status: Lost

	This was a more recent loss but this game was created in Game Maker Studio as a 2D space shooter starring simple block characters from a far off planet (Basically my excuse as to why I can’t draw to save my life). Captain Pix and his.. ahem… “female friend” Pax join forces to defeat an alien species…. Actually.. I just made that last line up.. I literally spent most of my time on the title and then gave up XD

	The House Of Ghouls And Traps (or THOGAT) was intended to be a point and click horror game made with Game Maker Studio but was scrapped before any real work was done and was turned into an April fools joke that never got released. And at this point the source code and any compiled builds have been lost. However, The title song simply known as THOGAT exists online as an archive and has been used in [Markiplier’s Mansion](https://pikakid98-games.github.io/markipliers-mansion).

	Pikakid98’s Adventure (Also known as Jordan’s Adventure) was intended to be a game based on my adventures. However the game was scrapped due to a lack of ideas. 3 Different variants of this game exist. Those being “Jordan’s Adventure”, “Pikakid98’s Adventure” and “Pikakid8’s Adventure” (with a typo in the title). The one with the typo is the most playable and has the most content but even then I have no intention of releasing any of them as they’re all worse than anything else and are incredibly lazily made.

<summary>Cat Warfare Demake</summary>

	Cat Warfare Demake was intended to be an 8-Bit RPG demake of [SonicboomColt](https://github.com/Sonicboomcolt)’s [Cat Warfare](https://www.notsoclassicgames.com/games/cat-warfare) and would have eventually been pitched as an official spin off to Cat Warfare and sold on Steam with permission from SonicboomColt and possibly a revenue split.. Let’s just say that the amount of content in the game didn’t even justify it being a free release on the depths of the internet with the only map being a premade sprite sheet that was intended as a placeholder.. The game was abandoned and the Cat Warfare series never happened as it stuck with only one game.

	Five Nights At Freddy’s: Purple Guy Origins (aka FNAFPGO or Simply FNAF: Purple Guy Origins) was a Five Night’s At Freddy’s fangame and was intended to be an RPG in the style of Five Nights At F`**`kboy’s with a more serious story going in depth to my own fanfiction based on purple guy.. However, This game never got past the “first room being slapped together” phase and therefore has no place anywhere online.

	Sheep was started as a project between me and [Simon (EyeShellJones)](https://www.youtube.com/@0768536387) as an eventual commerial product for EyeShellGames set in a dystopian universe where any minor law break results in death and all must obey a hivemind. The game was inspired by [Suits: A Business RPG](https://store.steampowered.com/app/410670). However, The progress done on it was so minor that it was never published anywhere on the internet and the source code rots away on the Steam cloud.

<summary>Cave Of The Dead +</summary>

	Engine: GameMaker Studio

	Cave Of The Dead + was planned as a complete rework of Cave Of The Dead in the same vain as [Cave Of The Dead Remastered](https://pikakid98-games.github.io/cave-of-the-dead-remastered) but with a completely different genre. This version was planned to be a 2D platforming roguelite like Spelunky but had even less work put in than the remaster as this version never even started getting reworked and only contained the original game and nothing more.
