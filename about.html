Who <i>ARE</i> you?</u></b></h2><h3><u></u></h3><h3>Pikakid98 Games was first formed in 2021 by me (<a href="https://pikakid98.github.io/">Pikakid98</a>)... Shocker, I know.. as a way to separate my freeware games from my company that would eventually be known as Pikakid98 Studios.<br></h3><h3>This never happened, however. Due to Pikakid98 Studios being mentioned in so many freeware games and scrapped projects (Whether by the page stating the game was created by the "company" or the "company" logo being used at the start), The name was scrapped and never became an official company. Yet the team never disbanded.<br></h3><h3>Pikakid98 Games is not (and never will be) an official LLC and is simply a small team (mostly just myself) that create small freeware games that vary wildly in quality<br></h3></div></div></section><div class="editable-style text-element silex-id-1714060295980-1 page-about paged-element paged-element-visible"><div class="silex-element-content normal"><h2><u>Wait, There's a team!?</u><u><br></u></h2><h3>Not really. It's more like a group of friends who occasionally chip in and contribute assets and code.</h3><h3>There's <a href="https://github.com/nhaselton">Nhaselton</a>&nbsp;responsible for most of the code in Adventure Guy and PurrCatory<br></h3><h3>Next is <a href="https://github.com/sonicboomcolt">SonicboomColt</a> who is responsible for one of the tracks in PurrCatory</h3><h3>But it's mostly just me working by myself for the most part. Adventure Guy was the first time I actually worked directly with someone and not just asking for code and trying to work my game around it like with PurrCatory</h3></div></div></body></html>
